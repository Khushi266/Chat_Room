# Chat_Room
This is a chat room created using the python Flask library and SocketIO library.  

You can view this website on : https://chat-room-5hn8.onrender.com  

But as Render does not support SocketIO, the chat room will not work, but it will definitely work on localhost.  

Here is a demo of the chatroom:
